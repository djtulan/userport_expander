# Userport Expander
C64 Userport Expander is a remake of a project from a "64'er Sonderheft" magazine.

You can find the scan (german language) [here](./docs/UP%2024%20Leitungen_k.pdf).

The driver software can be found [here](./Software/SH67.zip).

The C64 Userport Expander expands the C64 Userport from 8 Bit to 3x8bit.
